# Blood-Type-Distribution-by-Country
This project examines the distribution of blood types across various countries and regions around the world. Blood type, also known as a blood group, is a classification of blood based on the presence or absence of certain antigens and antibodies on red blood cells.
Understanding the distribution of blood types is not only interesting from a researcher and  scientific perspective but also has implications for healthcare, blood transfusions, and genetic studies. By exploring this dataset, i can gain insights into the prevalence of different blood types in different populations.
### Dataset
The dataset used in this project was scraped from Wikipedia, a reliable and widely used online encyclopedia. It provides information on the blood type distribution for each country or region, along with the corresponding population figures. 
The dataset consists of the following columns:
1.	Country: The name of the country or region.
2.	Population: The population count of the country or region.
3.	O+: The percentage of individuals with blood type O+.
4.	A+: The percentage of individuals with blood type A+.
5.	B+: The percentage of individuals with blood type B+.
6.	AB+: The percentage of individuals with blood type AB+.
7.	O-: The percentage of individuals with blood type O-.
8.	A-: The percentage of individuals with blood type A-.
9.	B-: The percentage of individuals with blood type B-.
10.	AB-: The percentage of individuals with blood type AB-.
### Acknowledgments
This project would not have been possible without the availability of data from Wikipedia. I would like to express my gratitude to the contributors and maintainers of the relevant Wikipedia pages.
### Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive analysis of blood type distribution across different countries and regions. By exploring this dataset, we can answer questions such as:
•	Which blood types are most common in certain countries?
•	Are there any noticeable patterns or trends in blood type distribution?
•	How does blood type distribution vary across continents or regions?
•	Are there any correlations between blood type distribution and other demographic factors?
The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to our understanding of human genetics, population health, and medical practices related to blood transfusions and organ transplantation
